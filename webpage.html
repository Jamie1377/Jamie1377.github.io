            I have expertise in Python and SQL, which I have applied in a Formula 1 (F1) related project. This project involved data analysis and visualization using SQL for data querying and manipulation, as well as Tableau for creating interactive dashboards and reports to gain insights into F1 race statistics and performance metrics.
